# AverageSalary

## Precompiled Version

The program has already been compiled, and the executable is located in the `bin` folder of the project. You can directly run the precompiled version by following the instructions below.

## Compiling the Program

If you need to compile the program yourself, there are two ways to do it:

### 1. **Using Visual Studio**

1. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
2. Select `Build` or `Rebuild` from the **Build** menu.
3. Visual Studio will compile the program and create the executable in the `bin` directory.

### 2. **Using the `compile.sh` Script**

If you're using Linux or Git Bash, you can compile the program using the provided `compile.sh` script.

1. Open a terminal (Git Bash or Linux terminal).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to compile the program:

   ```bash
   ./compile.sh

This will compile the AverageSalary.cpp file and create the executable in the bin folder.

## Running the Program
Once the program is compiled, you can run it in a Linux terminal or Git Bash. To run the program, use the following command:

 ```bash
   ./run.sh employees.json
